            <h1>Orthopedics</h1>
            <p>Orthopedics is the branch of medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of
            conditions, injuries, and disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system. This system includes bones, joints, muscles,
            ligaments, tendons, and nerves.
            
            Orthopedic care encompasses a wide range of treatments, from nonsurgical interventions like physical therapy and
            medications to surgical procedures such as joint replacement, fracture repair, and correction of deformities. Orthopedic
            specialists aim to restore function, alleviate pain, and improve the quality of life for patients.</p>
