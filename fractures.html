        2. Injury and Pathology
    
        <h2>Fractures</h2>
        <p>Types of fractures</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open (Compound): The broken bone pierces through the skin, increasing the risk of infection.</li>
            <li>Closed (Simple): The bone is broken but does not penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li>Simple: A clean break with minimal damage to surrounding tissues.</li>
            <li>Comminuted: The bone shatters into multiple fragments, often requiring surgical intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <bold>Healing stages for fractures:</bold>
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Hematoma Formation (Days 1 - 7):</bold>
        </p>
        <p>Blood vessels rupture, forming a clot (hematoma) at the injury site.<br>
            Inflammatory cells migrate to clean debris and promote healing.</p>
        <p>
            <bold>Callus Formation (Weeks 1 - 4):</bold>
        </p>
        <p>Fibroblasts and chondrocytes form a soft callus made of cartilage and fibrous tissue.<br>
            Later, osteoblasts replace the soft callus with a hard, bony callus.</p>
        <p>
            <bold>Remodeling (Months to Years):</bold>
        </p>
        <p>Osteoclasts resorb excess bone, reshaping it to restore normal structure and function.<br>
            Bone regains strength and density over time.</p>

    <div class="sprains-strains">
        <h2>Sprains:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Injury involving ligaments, which connect bones at a joint.</li>
            <li>Typically caused by stretching or tearing due to sudden twisting or impact.</li>
            <li>Common locations: ankles, wrists, and knees.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strain:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Injury involving muscles or tendons, which attach muscles to bones.</li>
            <li>Often caused by overstretching or excessive force.</li>
            <li>Common locations: lower back and hamstrings.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="arthritis">
        <h1>Arthritis</h1>
        
        <h2>Osteoarthritis (OA):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cause: Gradual breakdown of cartilage in weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and spine.</li>
            <li>Symptoms: Pain, stiffness, and reduced joint flexibility.</li>
            <li>Mechanism: Cartilage wears down, causing bones to rub against each other, leading to pain and bone spurs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cause: Autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the synovial membrane (lining of joints).</li>
            <li>Symptoms: Swelling, warmth, redness, and joint deformity.</li>
            <li>Mechanism: Inflammation thickens the synovium, damaging cartilage and bones over time.</li>
        </ul>
