    Here are some key **First Aid tips for orthopedic injuries**:
    
    <h3>Fractures (Broken Bones):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Immobilize the injured area: Avoid moving the injured limb and keep it as still as possible. If a splint is available,
        use it to immobilize the area.</li>
        <li>Control bleeding: If the bone is protruding through the skin (open fracture), cover the wound with a sterile bandage and
        apply pressure to stop bleeding.</li>
        <li>Apply ice: Place ice wrapped in a cloth or towel on the injured area to reduce swelling and pain</li>
        <li>Seek medical attention immediately: Always call emergency services for fractures, especially if they are severe or if
        the person cannot move the affected limb.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Sprains and Strains:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rest: Avoid putting weight or pressure on the injured area.</li>
        <li>Ice: Apply ice to reduce swelling (15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours for the first 48 hours).</li>
        <li>Compression: Use an elastic bandage (but not too tight) to compress the injured area and reduce swelling.</li>
        <li>Elevation: Keep the injured area elevated above the level of the heart to reduce swelling.</li>
        <li>Seek medical help: For severe pain, swelling, or difficulty moving the joint or muscle, it's important to get
        professional medical care.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Dislocations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not try to relocate the joint: Never attempt to pop the joint back into place.</li>
        <li>Immobilize the affected area: Use a splint or cloth to keep the joint from moving.</li>
        <li>Apply ice: Ice the area to reduce pain and swelling.</li>
        <li>Seek professional help immediately: Dislocations require medical intervention to prevent further damage to nerves and
        blood vessels.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Bone and Joint Pain (Minor):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rest the area: Ensure the person does not use the affected joint or limb.</li>
        <li>Ice or Heat: Use ice to reduce inflammation in the first 48 hours, and heat after that for muscle relaxation (only if no
        swelling is present).</li>
        <li>Pain relief: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage discomfort (ensure there
        are no contraindications).</li>
        <li>Monitor: If pain persists or worsens, seek medical attention to rule out fractures or serious injuries.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Back Injuries:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid movement: If the injury involves the back, have the person lie still and avoid unnecessary movements.</li>
        <li>Apply ice: Ice can help reduce inflammation and pain if applied to the back (avoid direct skin contact with ice).</li>
        <li>Use a firm surface: When transporting someone with a suspected back injury, keep them on a flat, firm surface to prevent
        further injury.</li>
        <li>Seek professional help: Back injuries can involve the spine, so they require immediate medical attention.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>General Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pain management: For any orthopedic injury, over-the-counter medications can help reduce pain. Always follow the dosing
        instructions.</li>
        <li>Monitor for shock: Orthopedic injuries can lead to shock, especially if there is severe bleeding or pain. Symptoms of
        shock include rapid pulse, shallow breathing, and pale skin. If shock is suspected, keep the person warm, lie them down,
        and elevate their legs if possible, while waiting for medical help.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h4><em>Important Note:</em></h4>
    <p>Orthopedic injuries can sometimes cause complications, especially if not treated properly. Always consult a healthcare
    professional or seek emergency medical attention for severe injuries.</p>
