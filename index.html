                    <h2>Fractures</h2>
                    <p>Types of fractures</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open (Compound): The broken bone pierces through the skin, increasing the risk of infection.
                        </li>
                        <li>Closed (Simple): The bone is broken but does not penetrate the skin.</li>
                        <li>Simple: A clean break with minimal damage to surrounding tissues.</li>
                        <li>Comminuted: The bone shatters into multiple fragments, often requiring surgical intervention.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                    <h4><em>Hematoma Formation (Days 1 - 7):</em></h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>Blood vessels rupture, forming a clot (hematoma) at the injury site.<br>
                        Inflammatory cells migrate to clean debris and promote healing.</p>
                    <p>Purpose:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stabilizes the fracture temporarily.</li>
                        <li>Inflammatory cells (e.g., macrophages and neutrophils) clean debris and release signals to
                            attract
                            repair
                            cells.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    <h4><em>Callus Formation (Weeks 1 - 4):</em></h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fibroblasts and chondrocytes form a soft callus made of cartilage and fibrous tissue.<br>
                        Later, osteoblasts replace the soft callus with a hard, bony callus.</p>
                    <p>Purpose: Provides stability and prepares for bone remodeling.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h4><em>Remodeling (Months to Years):</em></h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>Osteoclasts resorb excess bone, reshaping it to restore normal structure and function.<br>
                        Bone regains strength and density over time.</p>
